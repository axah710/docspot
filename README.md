DocSpot - Flutter App

Welcome to DocSpot, the ultimate doctor appointment scheduling app built with Flutter. Currently under development, DocSpot aims to provide a seamless experience for users to book and manage their medical appointments effortlessly. The app may include the following features or some of them as development progresses:

The app will feature user-friendly account creation, secure OTP verification, Face ID login, and a comprehensive profile management system. Users will be greeted with a welcoming screen and an easy login process, while new users can enjoy an intuitive introduction to the app.

The main dashboard, or homescreen, will offer real-time notifications, the ability to find nearby doctors, and browse by doctor specialties. Features like recommendation engines for doctors, appointment success confirmations, schedule change alerts, and cancellation management ensure a smooth user experience. Additionally, users can manage payments, initiate and confirm appointments, and communicate through the inbox and messaging features.

With a focus on security, the app includes features for password resets, security settings, and logout options. Users can also manage personal information, view test results and diagnostics, and access FAQs for quick help. The app supports multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.

To run DocSpot locally, ensure Flutter is installed, clone the repository, and use the provided commands to get started. Contributions from the community are welcome.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop and enhance DocSpot!
