////? The tests we implemented provide several key benefits:

////! The tests act as a form of documentation for expected behavior.
////! By reading the test, you can immediately understand what the API service
////! should do in different scenarios (e.g., a successful signup vs. a failed signup).

////! The second test, which simulates
////! a failed API response, ensures that your application gracefully handles
////! API errors. This prevents potential crashes or unhandled exceptions in the
////! app when the API returns an error (e.g., invalid credentials, existing email).

////! These tests validate that your app follows the contract with the API.
////! By mocking the expected responses, you're ensuring that the app behaves
////! correctly according to the structure of the request
////! (SignupRequestBody) and response (SignupResponse).


////? Summary:

////! Ensures the app handles signup functionality correctly.
////! No dependency on actual API availability during tests.
////! Automatic validation of API handling during development and refactoring.


////? Network request unit testing:

////! We will use Mockito and build_runner packages. The build_runner will generate mock classes that simulate the real Dio.
////! MockDio() is a mock request instance. If we used Dio(), it would make real requests, but here we only simulate the operation.
////! We will create test groups that contain test cases. We use `when()` to simulate the request and `thenAnswer()` to simulate the response.
////! Mock data simulates the real data to avoid making real network requests, allowing us to work with the simulated mock class.
