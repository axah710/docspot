Network Request Unit Testing

In this process, we will use the `Mockito` and `build_runner` packages to effectively simulate network requests for unit testing.

Steps:

1. Mock Class Generation:  
   The `build_runner` package will be used to generate mock classes. These mock classes simulate the behavior of real classes, such as Dio, without making actual network requests. 
   
2. Purpose of Mocking:  
   Mocking creates a class that mimics the real functionality of a network request. For instance, `MockDio()` is a mock instance of Dio. If we were to use `Dio()`, it would perform a real                    
   request. However, by using `MockDio()`, we can simulate network operations without actually calling external servers.

3. Test Groups and Test Cases:  
   We will organize our unit tests into groups, where each group will contain various test cases to ensure the network request's functionality is simulated correctly.

4. Simulating Responses:  
   The mock request will simulate both the request and the response. Instead of sending real data over the network, we will use mock data to simulate the expected behavior of the service.

5. Mock Data:  
   To fully simulate the process, we will create mock data that represents the response we expect from the server, ensuring we do not perform real network operations.

By using this approach, we can test network-related functionalities through simulation, working with mock classes and data without the need to execute real requests.
